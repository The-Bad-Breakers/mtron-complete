## what

Mtron Complete is a complete Freak of a modpack, made for Minecraft version 1.12.2. It has tech, nuclear bombs, veggie bacon, more tech, poor optimization, incomprehensible jokes, trains, cars, magic, lots of guns, pingas, Greg, tech, lots of interesting ways to die, and methamphetamine.
Listen, when I say there's tech, I mean it, there's GregTech, Thermal, IC2, Mekanism, Immersive Engineering, NuclearCraft, *and* HBM. *What were they thinking?*

Soooo basically, erm, yeah.. It kinda is sucks buut it's also so fucking awesome? and You will be breaking bad within MINUTES of playing this modpack, so [STOP SIMPING AND GET ONLINE!!!!!](https://discord.gg/yqBnwPR2dR)

Requires at least 6 GB of RAM, I think? maybe be able to work with 5 gigs I haven't tested. More is better though, trust me.
